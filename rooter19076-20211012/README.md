# Rooter for Atomic Pi

USB/SDCARD ONLY FOR NOW. (I'm fighting with the mmc)

* Use Etcher to flash [openwrt-x86-64-uefi-gpt-ext4.img.gz](openwrt-x86-64-uefi-gpt-ext4.img.gz) onto a 2gb+ USB/SD
* Boot from USB/SD.
* Connect via wifi network ROOter, password rooter2017 (this will work even without antennas)
* Open webpage: 192.168.1.1

Wifi defaults to lan. (wifi client mode works pefectly)

Wired defaults to lan. WWAN tested with a usb Quectel EM12 and Huawei E3372.

Runs very fast from USB/SD. Everything SEEMS to work. Adblock installs and works.
